# Chapter: Analysis of Business

## Introduction
In this lecture, we will start by stepping back to get an overview of Analysis. After that, we will sharpen our analytic skills by using some real world, business applications. Along the way, we will continue to add to our visualization toolkit by learning how to use **CairoMakie, which is the premium backend to the Makie plotting package.

## What is Analysis
The English word *"Analysis"* comes from the Ancient Greek word meaning "a breaking up". The origin of the word is very appropriate. Wikidepia defines Analysis as 
> *"The process of breaking a complex topic or substance, into smaller parts, in order to gain a better understanding of it."*

The history of analysis as a human activity goes back to Ancient times, while the modern, formal concept of analysis has been ascribed to Alhezen, Descartes, Galileo and Newton. While the history of analysis is rooted in Math and Science, in practice, analysis is used in many different fields, ranging from Music and Literature, to Philosophy and Psychotherapy. It is used in the Public Sector to set Public Policy and to acquire Security Intelligence. It is used in the Private Sector to bring a more disciplined approach to Business and Economics.

While analysis is often associated with Math and Science, it is important to understand that analysis is a general process that is independent of domain. With respect, lawyers are not known for their Math and Science skills. And yet, lawyers, often turn out to be excellent analysts, because their profession requires the use of logical thinking to dispassionately examine the evidence, in order to formulate an argument, or an opinion. The objective of their process is not about finding the correct answers to a problem set. Their objective is to convince a judge or jury, to a particular point of view, based upon the evidence presented. This process is similar to the one used by analysts.
While the use of computers may allow the analyst to tackle more complex cases, it is important to understand that, at its core, analysis is an ancient, human activity that we have been using for thousands of years to help us understand the world around us. 

Let's take a break from the Ivory Tower and take a look at a couple of real world examples of how analysis is used in the business world. In the first example, we will take a look at the classic Microeconomics model of Supply and Demand, in order to gain a better understand of the market behaviors of Companies and Consumers. In the second example, we will create a Mortgage Calculator, in order to better understand how fixed-rate loans work in the US. We know that sounds really boring, but I promise, that it will be fascinating.
